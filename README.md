# NeuroBridge

A neural interface bridge system for processing and analyzing brain-computer interface data.

## Overview

NeuroBridge is a sophisticated system designed to facilitate communication between neural interfaces and computational systems. This project provides tools for signal processing, data analysis, and real-time neural data streaming.

## Features

- Real-time neural signal processing
- Advanced data filtering and analysis
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Support for multiple neural interface protocols
- Web-based visualization dashboard

## Project Structure

```
neurobridge/
├── neurobridge.py          # Core Python module
├── src/                    # React frontend source
├── public/                 # Static assets
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── package.json           # Node.js dependencies
```

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the NeuroBridge module:
```bash
python neurobridge.py
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

The NeuroBridge system consists of two main components:

1. **Backend (Python)**: Handles neural signal processing and data analysis
2. **Frontend (React)**: Provides a web-based interface for visualization and control

## Configuration

Configuration options can be set through environment variables or configuration files. See the documentation for detailed setup instructions.
