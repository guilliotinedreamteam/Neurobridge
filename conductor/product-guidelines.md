# Product Guidelines: NeuroBridge

## 1. Aesthetic Direction: Minimalist & Professional
NeuroBridge favors a light-themed, clinical aesthetic. The interface should feel like a high-end research instrument: clean white spaces, subtle gray borders, and razor-sharp typography. Avoid decorative elements that do not serve a functional or data-driven purpose.

## 2. Design Paradigm: Post-minimalism
We employ a post-minimalist approach, blending extreme structural simplicity with high-precision details. Interactive elements should have micro-interactions that feel deliberate and premium. Use a 4px/8px grid system to ensure perfect mathematical alignment across all components.

## 3. Brand Voice & Tone: Authoritative & Innovative
Our voice is bold and confident. We do not apologize for complexity; we master it. Communication should be direct and highlight the breakthrough nature of the technology.
- **Example:** "System integrity verified. Neural Stream Engine operating at peak performance."
- **Avoid:** "Everything looks okay, we're ready when you are."

## 4. Data Visualization: High Density / Scientific
We embrace the complexity of the brain. The dashboard provides maximum transparency by displaying all 128 channels and raw metrics by default. Visualizations (waveforms, heatmaps) should use high-contrast, scientific color scales that emphasize data accuracy over artistic flair.

## 5. Visual Hierarchy & Typography
- **Typography:** Use high-legibility sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or Roboto Mono for data).
- **Layout:** High-density data grids with creative, asymmetric layouts that maximize the use of widescreen monitors.
- **Color Palette:** Primary backgrounds in shades of white (#FFFFFF to #F8F9FA), with deep charcoal (#212529) for text and sharp, functional accents for system alerts (e.g., #007BFF for active, #DC3545 for error).
